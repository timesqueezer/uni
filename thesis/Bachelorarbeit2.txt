 	- reverse engineering, improving break points?
 		- regex instead of bytestring
 		- find "CA*E" in memory
 		- identify instructions that access specific memory/data

 	- "natural website behavior"
 		- anti automation
 		- ML based "captcha"
 		- counter anti automation stuff
 		- detect human/not human based on graph structure of pages
 		- ML focused
 		- focus points (detect human / try to beat "captcha")

 	- federated learning of bot detection (collaborative bot detection)
 		- existing captcha: google, cloudflare, hcaptcha
 		- privacy
 		- croud sourced detection approach
 		- learning without sharing traffic, only

 		- write multiple services aka websites
 		- design attacks to learn from

	35-40 seiten

	How can federated learning be utilized to implement a decentralized and privacy focused bot detection system for websites?
