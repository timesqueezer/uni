abstract = {Compared to other behavioural biometrics, mouse dynamics is a less explored area. General purpose data sets containing unrestricted mouse usage data are usually not available. The Balabit data set was released in 2016 for a data science competition which, despite the few users covered, can be considered the first adequate publicly available data set. This study presents a performance evaluation study on this data set for impostor detection. The existence of very short benchmark test sessions makes this data set challenging. Raw data were segmented into mouse actions, such as mouse move, point and click, and drag and drop, and then several features were extracted. Mouse data is not sensitive; therefore, it is possible to collect negative mouse dynamics data and to use two-class classifiers. Impostor detection performance was measured using decisions based on several actions. The best performance of 0.92 area under curve was obtained on the benchmark test sessions of the data set. Drag and drop mouse actions proved to be the best actions for impostor detection despite the fact that this type of action represented only 10\% of the data set.},

abstract = {Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.}

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new form of behavioral biometrics based on mouse dynamics, which can be used indifferent security applications. We develop a technique that can be used to model the behavioral characteristics from the captured data using artificial neural networks. In addition, we present an architecture and implementation for the detector, which cover all the phases of the biometric data flow including the detection process. Experimental data illustrating the experiments conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed detection technique are presented and analyzed. Specifically, three series of experiments are conducted. The main experiment, in which twenty-two participants are involved, reproduces real operating conditions in computing systems by giving participants an individual choice of operating environments and applications; 284 hours of raw mouse data are collected over 998 sessions, with an average of 45 sessions per user. The two other experiments, involving seven participants, provided a basis for studying the confounding factors arising from the main experiment by fixing the environment variables. In the main experiment, the performance results presented using receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves and a confusion matrix yield at the crossover point (i.e., threshold set for an equal error rate) a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 2.4649% and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 2.4614%.},
