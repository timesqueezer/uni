abstract = {Compared to other behavioural biometrics, mouse dynamics is a less explored area. General purpose data sets containing unrestricted mouse usage data are usually not available. The Balabit data set was released in 2016 for a data science competition which, despite the few users covered, can be considered the first adequate publicly available data set. This study presents a performance evaluation study on this data set for impostor detection. The existence of very short benchmark test sessions makes this data set challenging. Raw data were segmented into mouse actions, such as mouse move, point and click, and drag and drop, and then several features were extracted. Mouse data is not sensitive; therefore, it is possible to collect negative mouse dynamics data and to use two-class classifiers. Impostor detection performance was measured using decisions based on several actions. The best performance of 0.92 area under curve was obtained on the benchmark test sessions of the data set. Drag and drop mouse actions proved to be the best actions for impostor detection despite the fact that this type of action represented only 10\% of the data set.},

abstract = {Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.}
