## How to Expose
### Prior
- You got some topic ideas. You can pick one to reserve it for 7 days to decide if you want this topic.
- After the 7 days the topic is considered open again and I might give it to another student.

### Formals Expose
- You picked decided on a topic and told me? Get the template from https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/inst/ab/snp/courses/material/templates.html which includes every formality.
- You now have around 6 weeks to finish your expose.
- The following times are suggestions..
  - Sent me a first, raw version in the first 2 weeks.
  - Sent me another almost complete version in the first 4 weeks.
    - This version should include all content points (see below) but not necessarily in full detail.
  - Sent another version to Mathias within the 6 weeks.
- **Continue writing even if you are waiting for feedback, I try to be timely on this.** 
- You have the ok of Mathias and me?
  - Remind me to add an entry in the thesis tool.

### Content Expose
- Introduction (0.5 - 1 page)
  - Introduction to the topic and the problem you are trying to address.  Why do we need a new approach/solution for the topic? Why this topic (motivation)?
- State of the art/Related work (1 - 2 pages)
  - What is the state of the art? 
  - What is not covered in the state of the art that you want to cover?
    - e.g., related work is not scalable, privacy friendly, ...
- Method (1.5 - 3 pages)
  - How do you plan to approach/solve the problem?
    - e.g., 
      - Proof of concept
        - Machine Learning, Crypto, ...
      - Theoretical proof
      - Empirical study
  - How to evaluate?
    - This does not need to be complete, but you should think about ways to evaluate. Often you could build some software and evaluate its performance.
  - What are your expected results?
- Time plan. Do this when you are done with everything else. (~1 page)
  - High level overview, plan on two weeks granularity.
    - Keep in mind that the Expose will take some time.
  - Give yourself more time that you would think.
  - Aim to be done one month before the deadline.
    - so you have one month as backup. You will likely need it.


## How to Thesis
### Setup
- Read the formalities [Bachelor Inf.](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/studies/bachelor/inf/inf-forms.html), [Master Inf.](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/studies/masterinf/inf-forms.html)
- You have the ok to register?
  - Remind me to create a thesis-yourname channel in Mattermost
  - Remind me to create a git repository for you in our gitlab
    - All code should be there, no public repository
- If you do not have a second supervisor (Zweitgutachter) yet tell me. Normally this is either Prof. Federrath or Prof. Edinger.
  
### Formals Thesis
- We have a regular meeting every two weeks. This meeting is optional, but cancel the appointment at least one day prior.
- Write every week a 1-2 sentences what you did or what the current problem are in the thesis channel. It is totally okay to write that you did nothing.
- There is an intermediate presentation for the working group after 50% of your time passed.
- Write me if you need help.

### Content


### FAQ
- What if ...
  - Write me!

- What if I find literature BEFORE REGISTERING that the problem is already solved?
  - Are there parts that are unsolved?
  - Is the solution good?
  - Can the solution be improved, performance, privacy friendly, better evaluation...?
  - We can also find another topic.

- What if I find literature AFTER REGISTERING that the problem is already solved?
  - Same as above. But also:
  - We can shift the focus of the thesis to another subproblem. Only in a few cases everything is solved perfectly.

- What if I cannot solve the problem?
  - That is okay. It will not have an effect on your grade.
  - Try to solve subproblems.
  - Try to solve it inefficient.

- What if I cannot solve the problem AT ALL?
  - Write why you are not able to solve it.
  - Try to find related work that states the same/similar
  - Give potential solutions what to do.

- Will a bad result (no solution, bad solution, ...) affect my Grade?
  - A bad outcome is also an outcome. This will not affect your grade!
    - To be completely open: It is harder to write and evaluate a "bad" result. 
    - You should explain why this is the outcome. Do not just state: "It is impossible", "was to hard", ...
  - Often we can shift the focus of the thesis to avoid this.
  - However if everything does not work you should try to evaluate why it does not.
